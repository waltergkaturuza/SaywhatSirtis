# Case Management Statistics Fix - Summary

## Problem Identified
The case management page was showing 0 closed cases instead of the expected 1 closed case, despite the user knowing they had closed a case.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Database Verification**: Confirmed that 1 CLOSED case exists in the database (CASE-2025-00000004)
2. **API Transformation**: Verified that the API correctly transforms database statuses (CLOSED → closed)
3. **Permission Mismatch**: Discovered that the admin user has roles ['ADMIN', 'SUPER_USER'] and role 'SYSTEM_ADMINISTRATOR', but the API was checking for lowercase values like 'admin' and 'manager'

## Fixes Applied

### 1. API Permission Logic Fixed
**File**: `src/app/api/call-centre/cases/route.ts`
- Updated permission check to handle case-insensitive role matching
- Now checks: `session.user.roles?.some(role => ['admin', 'manager', 'super_user'].includes(role.toLowerCase()))`
- Also checks: `['system_administrator', 'admin', 'manager'].includes(session.user.role?.toLowerCase())`

### 2. Frontend Permission Logic Enhanced
**File**: `src/app/call-centre/case-management/page.tsx`
- Added role-based access checks alongside existing permission checks
- Now includes: `userRoles.some(role => ['admin', 'manager', 'callcentre_officer'].includes(role.toLowerCase()))`

### 3. Debug Logging Added
- Added comprehensive logging to trace data flow from API to frontend
- Added status counting verification in frontend

## Verification Tests
✅ Permission logic test confirms admin user will now have access
✅ Database contains expected case data (1 closed case)
✅ API transformation logic working correctly

## Expected Result
After proper authentication, the case management page should now display:
- Total cases: 4
- Open cases: 1  
- In Progress cases: 1
- Pending cases: 1
- **Closed cases: 1** (previously showing 0)
- Overdue cases: 1

## Next Steps
1. User needs to log in with admin credentials at http://localhost:3000/auth/signin
2. Navigate to case management page to verify statistics are now correct
3. Remove debug logging once functionality is confirmed working

## Technical Details
The issue was a classic authorization problem where the frontend and API had mismatched permission checking logic. The admin user's roles were stored in uppercase ('ADMIN', 'SUPER_USER') but the API was doing case-sensitive matching against lowercase values ('admin', 'manager'). This caused all API requests to be rejected with 403 Forbidden, resulting in empty case data and zero statistics.
