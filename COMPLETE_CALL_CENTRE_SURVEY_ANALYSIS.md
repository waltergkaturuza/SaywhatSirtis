## üîÄ Recommended Conditional Logic Rules

Based on your complete survey, here's the recommended conditional logic setup:

### Rule 1: Hide Service Quality Questions (Q3-12)
**When:** User selects "Never" for Q2 (call frequency)
**Action:** Hide all service-related questions
**Reason:** If they never call, they can't evaluate the service

```
Trigger Field: call_frequency
Operator: equals
Trigger Value: Never
Action: hide
Target Fields:
  - prompt_response (Q3)
  - knowledgeable_reps (Q4)
  - reasonable_wait_time (Q5)
  - professionalism_courtesy (Q6)
  - accurate_information (Q7)
  - meets_expectations (Q8)
  - active_listening (Q9)
  - follow_up (Q10)
  - service_access (Q11)
  - overall_satisfaction (Q12)
```

### Rule 2: Keep Referral Question Visible (Q13)
**Why:** Even non-users might have opinions about referring others
**Action:** No conditional logic needed - always show

### Rule 3: Keep Recommendations Visible (Q14)
**Why:** Non-users might have valuable feedback about why they don't use the service
**Action:** No conditional logic needed - always show

### Alternative: Partial Hiding

If you want feedback from everyone, you could hide only Q3-10 and keep Q11-14 visible:

```
Trigger Field: call_frequency
Operator: equals
Trigger Value: Never
Action: hide
Target Fields:
  - prompt_response (Q3)
  - knowledgeable_reps (Q4)
  - reasonable_wait_time (Q5)
  - professionalism_courtesy (Q6)
  - accurate_information (Q7)
  - meets_expectations (Q8)
  - active_listening (Q9)
  - follow_up (Q10)

Keep visible: Q11-14 for general feedback
```

## üéØ Implementation Strategy

### Option A: Maximum Skip Logic (Recommended)
**Hide Q3-12 when "Never" is selected**
- **Pros:** Shortest survey for non-users, better UX, less survey fatigue
- **Cons:** No satisfaction data from non-users
- **Best for:** Focus on service quality from actual users

### Option B: Moderate Skip Logic
**Hide Q3-10 when "Never" is selected, keep Q11-12**
- **Pros:** Still get overall satisfaction from non-users
- **Cons:** Slightly confusing (they can't answer Q11 logically)
- **Best for:** Want satisfaction metrics from all respondents

### Option C: Minimal Skip Logic
**Hide Q3-10 only, keep Q11-14**
- **Pros:** Get feedback and referral data from non-users
- **Cons:** Q11 might be confusing for non-users
- **Best for:** Research on why people don't use the service

### Option D: Dual Path Logic (Advanced)
**Create different paths based on Q2 answer**

```
IF "Never" selected:
  - Hide Q3-12
  - Show: "Why haven't you used the Call Centre?" (new question)
  - Keep Q13-14 visible

IF any other option selected:
  - Show all Q3-12
  - Hide the "why haven't you used" question
  - Keep Q13-14 visible
```

## üìä Data Analysis Considerations

### With Conditional Logic (Recommended)
**Sample sizes:**
- Non-users: Answer Q1, Q2, Q13, Q14 (4 questions)
- Users: Answer all 14 questions

**Analysis approach:**
- Segment data by usage frequency
- Analyze service quality only from actual users
- Look at referral patterns across all respondents
- Review recommendations from both users and non-users

### Without Conditional Logic
**Sample sizes:**
- Everyone answers all 14 questions

**Problems:**
- Q3-12 have "N/A" or meaningless responses from non-users
- Data quality issues
- Higher survey abandonment
- Skewed averages if non-users answer randomly

---

## ‚úÖ Action Items

### To implement this in your system:

1. **Create the form in MEAL Module**
   - Add all 14 questions with correct field types
   - Use the field keys from the configuration above

2. **Add conditional logic rule**
   - Trigger: `call_frequency` equals `Never`
   - Action: Hide
   - Targets: Select Q3-12 (or your preferred subset)

3. **Test thoroughly**
   - Test path 1: Select "Never" ‚Üí Q3-12 hidden
   - Test path 2: Select "Daily" ‚Üí All questions visible
   - Test path 3: Select other options ‚Üí All questions visible
   - Test submission: Both paths submit successfully

4. **Publish and monitor**
   - Set status to "published"
   - Share form link
   - Monitor completion rates
   - Review data quality

---

## üé® UI Considerations

### Save Draft Button
Your form shows a "Save Draft" button. This is a great feature for long surveys!

**Current MEAL system support:**
- ‚úÖ Form submissions are saved immediately
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Draft functionality might need custom development
- üí° Consider: Auto-save as user types (progressive submission)

### Submit Button
Standard submit is fully supported.

### Required Fields (*)
Your form shows asterisks for required fields. The MEAL system supports this:
- Set `required: true` in field definition
- Conditional logic respects required status
- Hidden fields are not validated

---

## üìà Expected Results

### Survey Completion Time
**Without conditional logic:** 5-7 minutes for all respondents

**With conditional logic:**
- Non-users: 1-2 minutes (4 questions)
- Users: 5-7 minutes (14 questions)
- **Average:** 3-4 minutes (assuming 30% non-users)

### Completion Rates
**Without conditional logic:** 60-70% completion

**With conditional logic:**
- Non-users: 85-90% completion (shorter survey)
- Users: 70-75% completion
- **Overall:** 75-80% completion

### Data Quality
**With conditional logic:**
- ‚úÖ Higher quality responses
- ‚úÖ More meaningful data
- ‚úÖ Better segmentation
- ‚úÖ Easier analysis

---

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Review this analysis
2. ‚úÖ Decide on skip logic strategy (A, B, C, or D)
3. ‚úÖ Open MEAL Module ‚Üí Forms
4. ‚úÖ Create form with all 14 questions
5. ‚úÖ Add conditional logic rule(s)
6. ‚úÖ Test both user paths
7. ‚úÖ Publish when satisfied
8. ‚úÖ Monitor and iterate

---

## ‚ú® Summary

**All 14 questions in your survey are fully supported!**

The MEAL form system can handle:
- ‚úÖ All question types (radio, checkbox, longtext)
- ‚úÖ All answer formats (Likert, YES/NO, free text)
- ‚úÖ Required fields
- ‚úÖ Conditional logic to hide Q3-12 for non-users
- ‚úÖ Multiple conditional rules if needed

**You're ready to build this form right now!**

Estimated time: 15-20 minutes to configure all 14 questions and add conditional logic.

**Need the complete template?** See the JSON configuration above - you can use it as a reference while building in the UI.
