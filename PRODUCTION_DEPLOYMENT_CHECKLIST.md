## Deployment Steps

### 1. Push Code to Production
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Production stability fixes - 502 error resolution"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Verify Deployment
- [ ] Check build logs for errors
- [ ] Verify health endpoints respond
- [ ] Test critical user flows
- [ ] Monitor error rates

### 3. Monitor Initial Performance
- [ ] Check response times
- [ ] Monitor memory usage
- [ ] Verify database connections
- [ ] Watch error logs

## Post-Deployment Monitoring

- [ ] Error logging functional

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur:

### 1. Immediate Rollback
```bash
# Revert to previous stable version
git revert HEAD
git push origin main
```

### 2. Emergency Response
