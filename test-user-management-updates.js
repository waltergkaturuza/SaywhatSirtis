    console.log('3. useEffect triggers fetchDepartments()')
    console.log('4. API calls /api/hr/departments (requires authentication)')  
    console.log('5. If successful: departments dropdown shows real HR departments')
    console.log('6. If failed: departments dropdown shows fallback departments')
    console.log('7. Same flow applies to UserForm component')
    
    console.log('\n🎯 Expected Results:')

    console.log('2. Go to Admin > User Management') 
    console.log('3. Click "Add User" button')
    console.log('4. Check Department dropdown - should show HR departments, not hardcoded ones')
    console.log('5. Check network tab - should see call to /api/hr/departments')
