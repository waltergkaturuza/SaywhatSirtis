# Database Connectivity and Employee Field Mapping - COMPLETE ✅

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Database Connectivity Issue ✅
- **Problem**: Local development couldn't connect to Supabase database
- **Root Cause**: Connection timeout too short and temporary network issues
- **Solution**: Added `connect_timeout=60` parameter to DATABASE_URL
- **Result**: Database connection now works properly

### 2. Employee Field Mapping Issues ✅
- **Problem**: Form fields didn't align with database schema (snake_case vs camelCase)
- **Solution**: Fixed all field mappings in `/api/hr/employees` endpoint

## Key Fixes Applied

### Database Configuration
```bash
# Before: Short timeout causing connection failures
DATABASE_URL="postgres://...?sslmode=require"

# After: Extended timeout for reliable connections
DATABASE_URL="postgres://...?sslmode=require&connect_timeout=60"
```

### Employee API Field Mappings
```javascript
// Fixed POST method sanitizedData:
first_name: formData.firstName,           // was firstName
last_name: formData.lastName,             // was lastName  
phone_number: formData.phoneNumber,       // was phoneNumber
emergency_contact: formData.emergencyContactName,  // was emergencyContactName
hire_date: formData.hireDate,             // was startDate
date_of_birth: formData.dateOfBirth,      // was missing
emergency_contact_phone: formData.emergencyContactPhone,  // was missing
supervisor_id: sanitizedData.supervisorId,  // was missing
is_supervisor: sanitizedData.isSupervisor,  // was missing
```

### GET Method Fixes
```javascript
// Fixed supervisor relationship query:
employees: {  // Correct Prisma relationship name
  select: {
    first_name: true,    // snake_case field names
    last_name: true,
    email: true,
    position: true
  }
}

// Fixed data transformation:
firstName: emp.first_name,        // was emp.firstName
lastName: emp.last_name,          // was emp.lastName
phone: emp.phone_number,          // was emp.phoneNumber
startDate: emp.hire_date,         // was emp.startDate
isSupervisor: emp.is_supervisor,  // was emp.isSupervisor
isReviewer: emp.is_reviewer,      // was emp.isReviewer
```

## Database Status Confirmed
- ✅ Supabase database is active and running
- ✅ Contains 5 employee records with proper structure
- ✅ All field names match our schema expectations
- ✅ Connection working from local development

## API Status
- ✅ Development server running on localhost:3000
- ✅ Employee API endpoint responding (401 Unauthorized = requires auth)
- ✅ Field mappings aligned with database schema
- ✅ Ready for employee creation testing

## Next Steps for Testing
1. Access the HR dashboard with proper authentication
2. Test employee creation form functionality
3. Verify data is properly stored in both users and employees tables
4. Test supervisor assignment and relationships

## Files Modified
- `.env.local` - Added connection timeout parameter
- `src/app/api/hr/employees/route.ts` - Fixed all field mappings
- `EMPLOYEE_FIELD_MAPPING_FIX_COMPLETE.md` - Documentation

## Impact
The "add employees" functionality should now work correctly with proper field mapping between the frontend form, API endpoint, and database schema. All database connectivity issues have been resolved.
