# Call Centre Field Mapping and Edit Button Fix - Complete

## Issues Fixed ✅

### 1. Officer Field Not Displaying
**Problem**: Officer field showing as blank in call records table and detail view
**Root Cause**: API returned `officerName` but frontend expected `officer`
**Solution**: Added field mapping in API transformation:
```typescript
officer: call.officerName || call.assignedOfficer || 'N/A'
```

### 2. Communication Mode Field Missing
**Problem**: Communication mode showing as blank
**Root Cause**: API field `modeOfCommunication` not mapped to frontend `communicationMode`
**Solution**: Added mapping:
```typescript
communicationMode: call.modeOfCommunication || 'N/A'
```

### 3. Call Duration Not Calculated
**Problem**: Duration field showing as blank or N/A
**Root Cause**: No call timing mechanism in place
**Solution**: 
- Added `callStartTime` and `callEndTime` to new call form
- Updated API to handle timing fields
- Added duration calculation in API response:
```typescript
duration: call.callEndTime && call.callStartTime ? 
  `${Math.round((new Date(call.callEndTime).getTime() - new Date(call.callStartTime).getTime()) / 60000)} min` : 'N/A'
```

### 4. Call Validity Field Missing
**Problem**: Validity field showing as blank
**Solution**: Added mapping:
```typescript
validity: call.callValidity || 'N/A'
```

### 5. Date Formatting Issue
**Problem**: "Invalid Date" showing in call details
**Root Cause**: Date not properly serialized
**Solution**: Added proper ISO string conversion:
```typescript
dateTime: call.createdAt?.toISOString() || new Date().toISOString()
```

### 6. Edit Button Not Functional
**Problem**: Edit button had no onClick handler
**Solution**: Added navigation functionality:
```typescript
onClick={() => {
  window.location.href = `/call-centre/cases/${call.id}/edit`;
}}
```

### 7. Production Build Failure
**Problem**: TypeScript compilation errors due to duplicate properties
**Root Cause**: Duplicate `voucherIssued` and `modeOfCommunication` properties
**Solution**: Removed duplicates, kept proper mappings

## Files Modified 📝

1. **`src/app/api/call-centre/calls/route.ts`**
   - Added field mappings for frontend compatibility
   - Fixed duplicate properties
   - Added call timing handling
   - Improved date serialization

2. **`src/app/call-centre/all-calls/page.tsx`**
   - Added onClick handler for edit button
   - Enhanced edit functionality

3. **`src/app/call-centre/new-call/page.tsx`**
   - Added call timing fields (`callStartTime`, `callEndTime`)
   - Set start time on form load
   - Set end time on form submission

## Database Fields Used 🗃️

From `call_records` table:
- `officerName` → mapped to `officer`
- `assignedOfficer` → fallback for `officer`
- `modeOfCommunication` → mapped to `communicationMode`
- `callValidity` → mapped to `validity`
- `callStartTime` → for duration calculation
- `callEndTime` → for duration calculation
- `createdAt` → mapped to `dateTime`

## Testing Status 🧪

### Production Deployment
- ✅ TypeScript compilation fixed
- ✅ Build process successful
- ✅ Render deployment should work

### Expected Results
After these fixes, the call records should display:
- ✅ Officer names (from database records)
- ✅ Communication modes ("inbound", etc.)
- ✅ Call durations (calculated from start/end times)
- ✅ Proper validity status
- ✅ Correctly formatted dates
- ✅ Functional edit buttons

## Next Steps 🔄

1. **Verify Production**: Check that Render redeploys successfully
2. **Test Interface**: Confirm all fields display correctly in browser
3. **Test New Calls**: Create a new call to verify timing capture
4. **Test Edit Function**: Verify edit button navigates correctly

## API Response Format 📋

The `/api/call-centre/calls` endpoint now returns:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "calls": [
    {
      "id": "uuid",
      "officer": "System Administrator",
      "communicationMode": "inbound", 
      "duration": "5 min",
      "validity": "valid",
      "dateTime": "2025-10-01T11:57:16.975Z",
      "callNumber": "0000004/2025",
      "caseNumber": "CASE-2025-00000004",
      "callerName": "Chipo Gwenzwa",
      "purpose": "Information and Counselling",
      "status": "OPEN"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Resolution Status ✅
