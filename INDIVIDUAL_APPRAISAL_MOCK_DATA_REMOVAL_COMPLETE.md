# Individual Performance Appraisals - Mock Data Removal Complete

## 🎯 Objective
Replace all hardcoded mock data in individual performance appraisal pages with real backend integration, enabling users to view detailed performance appraisals for actual employees.

## 📊 Implementation Overview

### ✅ Before (Mock Data System)
- **Hardcoded Function**: `getSampleAppraisal()` with static employee data
- **Limited Data**: Only 2 sample employees (John Doe, Michael Adebayo)
- **Static Content**: Fixed performance areas, achievements, development plans
- **No Database Integration**: All data was hardcoded in the component

### ✅ After (Dynamic Backend Integration)
- **API-Driven**: `/api/hr/performance/appraisals/[id]` endpoint
- **Unlimited Employees**: Supports all employees in the database
- **Real-Time Data**: Performance reviews, achievements, feedback from database
- **Role-Based Access**: Proper security and permission controls

## 🔧 Technical Implementation
