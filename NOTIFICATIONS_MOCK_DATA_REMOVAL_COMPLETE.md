# HR Performance Appraisals - Notifications Mock Data Removal Complete

## üéØ Objective
Remove all hardcoded mock data from the Notifications tab in the HR Performance Appraisals module and replace with real backend data.

## üìä Mock Data Identified & Removed

### ‚úÖ Before (Hardcoded)
1. **Due This Week**: "8 appraisals are due for completion this week"
2. **Progress Updates**: "45 new progress updates have been submitted for review"  
3. **Recent Completions**: "23 appraisals were completed and submitted this week"
4. **Overdue Appraisals**: Already dynamic (from previous implementation)

### ‚úÖ After (Dynamic)
1. **Due This Week**: `${notifications.dueThisWeek} appraisals are due for completion this week`
2. **Progress Updates**: `${notifications.progressUpdates} new progress updates have been submitted for review`
3. **Recent Completions**: `${notifications.completedThisWeek} appraisals were completed and submitted this week`
4. **Overdue Appraisals**: `${statistics.overdueAppraisals} appraisals are overdue and require immediate attention`

## üîß Technical Implementation

### 1. Backend API Creation
**New Endpoint**: `/api/hr/performance/notifications`

**Features**:
- **Date Range Calculation**: Automatically calculates current week (Sunday to Saturday)
- **Role-based Access**: 
  - Admin/HR: See all organizational notifications
  - Employees: See only their personal notifications
- **Real-time Queries**: 
  - Due This Week: Reviews with due dates in current week (not completed)
  - Progress Updates: Reviews updated this week (in progress status)
  - Completed This Week: Reviews completed this week
- **Error Handling**: Proper authentication and authorization checks

### 2. Frontend Integration
**State Management**:
```typescript
const [notifications, setNotifications] = useState({
  dueThisWeek: 0,
  progressUpdates: 0,
  completedThisWeek: 0
})
```

**API Integration**:
- Added notifications API call to parallel fetch operations
- Proper error handling and loading states
- Seamless integration with existing data fetching

**UI Updates**:
- All notification cards now use dynamic data
- Loading states: "Loading..." while fetching data
- Maintained existing design and user experience

### 3. Database Queries
**Smart Calculations**:
```sql
-- Due This Week: Reviews due in current week (not completed)
WHERE reviewDate BETWEEN startOfWeek AND endOfWeek 
AND reviewStatus != 'completed'

-- Progress Updates: Reviews updated this week (in progress)
WHERE updatedAt BETWEEN startOfWeek AND endOfWeek 
AND reviewStatus = 'in_progress'

-- Completed This Week: Reviews completed this week
WHERE updatedAt BETWEEN startOfWeek AND endOfWeek 
AND reviewStatus = 'completed'
```
