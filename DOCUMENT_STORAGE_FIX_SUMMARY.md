# Document Upload/Download Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
- **Problem**: Document download failing with "File not found on disk" error
- **Root Cause**: Upload API was only saving metadata to database but not storing actual files on the filesystem
- **Specific Error**: `ENOENT: no such file or directory` when trying to access files in `/public/uploads/`

## Files Fixed

### 1. `/src/app/api/documents/upload/route.ts`
**Changes Made:**
- Added file system imports (`fs` and `path`)
- Implemented actual file storage to disk in the uploads directory
- Added proper error handling for file save operations
- Ensured uploads directory is created if it doesn't exist

**Key Code Added:**
```javascript
// Save file to disk
try {
  // Ensure uploads directory exists
  const uploadsDir = path.join(process.cwd(), 'public', 'uploads')
  await fs.mkdir(uploadsDir, { recursive: true })
  
  // Convert file to buffer and save
  const bytes = await file.arrayBuffer()
  const buffer = Buffer.from(bytes)
  const fullPath = path.join(process.cwd(), 'public', filePath)
  
  await fs.writeFile(fullPath, buffer)
  console.log(`✅ File saved to disk: ${fullPath}`)
  
} catch (fileError) {
  console.error('❌ File save error:', fileError)
  return NextResponse.json({ 
    success: false, 
    error: "Failed to save file to disk" 
  }, { status: 500 })
}
```

### 2. `/src/app/api/documents/[id]/download/route.ts`
**Changes Made:**
- Enhanced error messages to be more descriptive
- Added document details in error response
- Better debugging information

### 3. `/src/app/api/documents/audit/route.ts` (NEW)
**Purpose:**
- Admin utility to audit document storage
- Check which documents have missing files
- Cleanup orphaned database records

## Directory Structure Created
```
public/
└── uploads/          <- Created this directory for file storage
```

## How to Test the Fixes

### 1. Test New File Upload
1. Navigate to the document repository
2. Click "Upload Documents" or use the floating + button
3. Upload a new file
4. Verify the file appears in the document list
5. Try to download it - should work correctly

### 2. Test Existing Files (Will Fail)
The 2 existing documents in the database will still fail to download because:
- `UZBS_DISSERTATION_PROGRESS_REPORT_FORM_2025_7_signed.pdf`
- `SIRTIS Development Feedback - 06 AUG 2025.docx`

These were uploaded before the fix and don't have physical files on disk.

### 3. Clean Up Orphaned Records (Admin Only)
Use the audit API to clean up documents without files:
```bash
GET /api/documents/audit  # View document status
POST /api/documents/audit # Clean up missing files
```

## Status
- ✅ **Upload functionality**: Fixed - files now save to disk
- ✅ **Download functionality**: Fixed - works for new uploads
- ✅ **Error handling**: Improved with detailed messages
- ⚠️  **Existing files**: Need cleanup (2 orphaned records)

## Next Steps
1. Test new file upload/download workflow
2. Consider cleaning up the 2 orphaned database records
3. All future uploads will work correctly with both database metadata and file storage

## Technical Notes
- Files are stored in `/public/uploads/` with unique generated names
- Database stores the relative path `/uploads/filename`
- Download route constructs full path: `process.cwd() + '/public' + document.path`
- Added comprehensive error handling and logging
