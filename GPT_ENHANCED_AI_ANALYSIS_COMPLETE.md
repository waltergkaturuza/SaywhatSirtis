## üî¨ GPT Analysis Examples

### **Example 1: HR Contract with GPT**
```json
{
  "summary": "This appears to be a formal employee contract document containing terms of employment, compensation details, and legal obligations. Requires HR review and secure handling due to sensitive personal information.",
  "suggestedClassification": "CONFIDENTIAL",
  "keyTopics": ["Human Resources", "Employment Law", "Compensation", "Legal Compliance", "Staff Management"],
  "suggestedTags": ["HR", "Contract", "Employment", "Legal", "Confidential", "Personnel", "Documentation"],
  "securityRisks": ["Contains personal employee information requiring restricted access", "Legal document with sensitive compensation details"],
  "priority": "HIGH",
  "confidenceScore": 0.92
}
```

### **Example 2: Public Newsletter with GPT**  
```json
{
  "summary": "A monthly organizational newsletter designed for public distribution, likely containing updates, announcements, and general information suitable for broad audience consumption.",
  "suggestedClassification": "PUBLIC",
  "keyTopics": ["Communications", "Public Relations", "Organizational Updates", "Community Engagement"],
  "suggestedTags": ["Newsletter", "Communications", "Public", "Marketing", "Updates", "Community", "Monthly"],

## üîß Technical Implementation

### **OpenAI Integration**
- **Model**: GPT-3.5-turbo for optimal balance of intelligence and speed
- **Temperature**: 0.3 (lower temperature for consistent, analytical responses)
- **Max Tokens**: 800 (sufficient for comprehensive analysis)
- **Error Handling**: Robust fallback to rule-based analysis if GPT fails
- **JSON Parsing**: Smart extraction of structured analysis from GPT responses

### **Intelligent Prompting**
```javascript
const prompt = `Analyze this document for a professional organization:

Filename: ${filename}
Title: ${title}
Category: ${category}
File Type: ${fileType}

Please provide a JSON response with organizational context analysis...`
```

### **Hybrid Intelligence**
- **GPT Analysis**: When OpenAI API is available and working
- **Rule-Based Fallback**: When GPT unavailable or fails
- **Best of Both**: Combines GPT intelligence with rule-based reliability
- **Seamless Experience**: Users get intelligent analysis regardless of backend status
