# ✅ Conditional Logic Implementation Summary

## 🎉 Great News!

**Conditional logic (skip logic) is already fully implemented and working in your MEAL forms system!**

You asked: *"Can we have conditional logic so that if someone answers 'Never' to the Call Centre frequency question, the irrelevant questions won't be asked?"*

**Answer: YES! This feature is already built into your system and ready to use right now.**

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Database Structure

**Table:** `meal_forms`

**Relevant Columns:**
```sql
conditional_logic JSONB DEFAULT '[]'::jsonb  -- Stores conditional logic rules
indicator_mappings JSONB DEFAULT '[]'::jsonb -- Stores indicator mappings
schema JSONB                                 -- Stores form field definitions
```

**Indexes:**
```sql
idx_meal_forms_conditional_logic    -- GIN index for fast JSONB queries
idx_meal_forms_indicator_mappings   -- GIN index for indicator lookups
```

### Data Structure

**Conditional Logic JSON Format:**
```json
[
  {
    "id": "unique-uuid",
    "triggerField": "call_frequency",
    "operator": "equals",
    "triggerValue": ["Never"],
    "action": "hide",
    "targetFields": ["prompt_response", "knowledgeable_reps", "reasonable_wait_time"]
  }
]
```

### Code Components

**Key Files:**
1. `src/components/programs/MealModule.tsx` (lines 93-174, 809-852, 1335-1336)
   - State management for conditional rules
   - Rule builder UI
   - Rule evaluation logic

2. `src/app/api/meal/forms/[id]/route.ts` (lines 60, 70)
   - API endpoint for saving/loading rules

3. `src/app/api/admin/update-schema/route.ts`
   - Schema migration endpoint

4. `prisma/schema.prisma` (lines 1168-1169)
   - Database model definition

## 🎯 How It Works

### 1. Form Creation
```
User creates form → Adds fields → Configures conditional rules → Saves form
                                            ↓
                    Rules stored as JSON in database
```

### 2. Form Rendering
```
User opens form → System loads conditional rules → User answers questions
                                                          ↓
                              Rules evaluated in real-time as user types
                                                          ↓
                                    Fields shown/hidden dynamically
```

### 3. Rule Evaluation (Pseudocode)
```javascript
function evaluateConditionalLogic(fieldKey) {
  let visible = true
  let required = false
  
  for (const rule of conditionalLogic) {
    const triggerValue = data[rule.triggerField]
    
    // Check if trigger condition is met
    const triggerMatches = checkOperator(
      rule.operator,
      triggerValue,
      rule.triggerValue
    )
    
    // Apply action to target fields
    if (rule.targetFields.includes(fieldKey)) {
      if (triggerMatches) {
        switch (rule.action) {
          case 'show':  visible = true; break
          case 'hide':  visible = false; break
          case 'require': required = true; break
          case 'optional': required = false; break
        }
      }
    }
  }
  
  return { visible, required }
}
```

## 🚀 Supported Features

### Operators
| Operator | Type | Example |
|----------|------|---------|
| `equals` | Exact match | `"Never" = "Never"` |
| `not_equals` | Inverse match | `"Daily" ≠ "Never"` |
| `contains` | Substring | `"Great service" contains "Great"` |
| `greater_than` | Numeric | `25 > 18` |
| `less_than` | Numeric | `15 < 100` |

### Actions
| Action | Effect | Use Case |
|--------|--------|----------|
| `show` | Display fields | Progressive disclosure |
| `hide` | Hide fields | Skip irrelevant questions |

- AND logic: Can be achieved with multiple rules

### Complex Scenarios
✅ Multiple rules per form
✅ Multiple target fields per rule
✅ Nested dependencies (with caution)
✅ Cascading show/hide logic

## 📋 Your Specific Use Case

### Call Centre Survey Implementation

**Requirement:**
> If someone answers "Never" to "How frequently do you call the SAYWHAT Call Centre department?", hide questions 3, 4, and 5 (about Call Centre experience).

**Solution Configuration:**

```javascript
{
  "name": "SAYWHAT Call Centre Service Survey",
  "schema": {
    "fields": [
      {
        "key": "gender",
        "label": "1. What is your gender?",
        "type": "radio",
        "required": true,
        "options": ["Male", "Female", "Other"]
      },
      {
        "key": "call_frequency",
        "label": "2. How frequently do you call the SAYWHAT Call Centre department?",
        "type": "radio",
        "required": true,
        "options": ["Daily", "Weekly", "Monthly", "Rarely", "Never"]
      },
      {
        "key": "prompt_response",
        "label": "3. The Call Centre department responds promptly...",
        "type": "radio",
        "required": false,
        "options": ["5. Strongly Agree", "4. Agree", "3. Neutral", "2. Disagree", "1. Strongly Disagree"]
      },
      {
        "key": "knowledgeable_reps",
        "label": "4. The Call Centre representatives are knowledgeable...",
        "type": "radio",
        "required": false,
        "options": ["5. Strongly Agree", "4. Agree", "3. Neutral", "2. Disagree", "1. Strongly Disagree"]
      },
      {
        "key": "reasonable_wait_time",
        "label": "5. The wait time to connect with a Call Centre representative...",
        "type": "radio",
        "required": false,
        "options": ["5. Strongly Agree", "4. Agree", "3. Neutral", "2. Disagree", "1. Strongly Disagree"]
      }
    ]
  },
  "conditionalLogic": [
    {
      "id": "rule-001",
      "triggerField": "call_frequency",
      "operator": "equals",
      "triggerValue": ["Never"],
      "action": "hide",
      "targetFields": ["prompt_response", "knowledgeable_reps", "reasonable_wait_time"]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Expected Behavior:**

| User Selection | Questions Displayed |
|----------------|---------------------|
| "Never" | 1, 2 only (3, 4, 5 hidden) |
| "Daily" | 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (all shown) |
| "Weekly" | 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (all shown) |
| "Monthly" | 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (all shown) |
| "Rarely" | 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (all shown) |

**Time to Implement:** 5-10 minutes
**Difficulty:** Easy (no coding required)

- [ ] Test 3: Change from "Daily" to "Never" → Questions hide dynamically ✓
- [ ] Test 4: Submit form with "Never" selected → Submits successfully ✓
- [ ] Test 5: Submit form with "Daily" selected and all questions answered ✓
- [ ] Test 6: Open form on mobile device → Works correctly ✓
- [ ] Test 7: Open public form link → Conditional logic works ✓
- [ ] Form published and shared

---

## 🔒 Security & Validation

**Built-in Safeguards:**
1. ✅ Hidden fields are not required for validation
2. ✅ Hidden fields can still be submitted (if previously filled)
3. ✅ Rules evaluated client-side (fast response)
4. ✅ Rules also validated server-side (if needed)
5. ✅ Circular dependencies detected (logs warning)

**Access Control:**
- Only users with `ADMIN`, `SUPER_ADMIN`, `SYSTEM_ADMINISTRATOR`, `ADVANCE_USER_2`, `HR`, or `MEAL_ADMIN` roles can create/edit forms
- Public can submit forms (read-only access)
- Conditional logic rules cannot be modified by form submitters

---

## 📈 Performance Considerations

**Optimization:**
- Rules evaluated in O(n×m) time where n=rules, m=fields
- GIN indexes on JSONB columns for fast queries
- Client-side evaluation reduces server load
- Minimal re-renders using React state management

**Best Practices:**
- ✅ Keep rules simple and clear
- ✅ Limit to 10-15 rules per form (for UX clarity)
- ✅ Avoid circular dependencies
- ✅ Test performance with large forms (100+ fields)

---

## 🐛 Known Limitations

| Limitation | Workaround |
|------------|------------|
| No AND operator (all triggers are OR) | Create multiple rules |
| Can't reference previous form submissions | Use indicator aggregation |
| No regex pattern matching | Use `contains` operator |
| No date/time comparisons | Convert to numeric values |

**Note:** These are edge cases. Your Call Centre survey use case is fully supported!

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting Guide

### Problem: Rules don't work
**Causes:**
- Field keys don't match (case-sensitive)
- Trigger value typo
- Form not saved after adding rule

**Solution:**
- Verify field keys in form editor
- Check "Active Rules" list shows your rule
- Re-save the form

### Problem: Questions still show when they should hide
**Causes:**
- Browser cache
- Rule not activated
- Multiple conflicting rules

**Solution:**
- Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5)
- Check rule configuration
- Review all active rules for conflicts

### Problem: Can't find Conditional Logic section
**Causes:**
- Not in edit mode
- Insufficient permissions
- UI not scrolled down

**Solution:**
- Click "Edit" on the form
- Verify user role
- Scroll down past field list
