- **Enrollments**: ⚠️ Still has mock data arrays (lines 309-358)
- **Certificates**: ⚠️ Still has mock data arrays (lines 360-392)

### Mock Data Locations:
1. **Main Training Page**: `src/app/hr/training/page.tsx`
   - Lines 309-358: `const enrollments = [...]`
   - Lines 360-392: `const certificates = [...]`

2. **Enrollment Page**: `src/app/hr/training/enroll/page.tsx`
   - Lines 45-80: `const trainingPrograms = [...]`
   - Lines 81-123: `const employees = [...]`

   - Lines 43-99: `const certificates = [...]`

4. **Calendar Page**: `src/app/hr/training/calendar/page.tsx`
   - Lines 40-108: `const events = [...]`

## 🎯 NEXT STEPS TO COMPLETE

### 1. Replace Mock Arrays with State Variables
```typescript
// Replace in main training page
const [enrollments, setEnrollments] = useState<any[]>([])
const [certificates, setCertificates] = useState<any[]>([])

// Add API fetch functions
const fetchEnrollmentsAndCertificates = async () => {
  // Fetch from /api/hr/training/enrollments and /api/hr/training/certificates
}
```

### 2. Update Other Training Pages
- **Enroll Page**: Connect to employees API
- **Certificates Page**: Connect to certificates API  
- **Calendar Page**: Connect to training sessions API
