# Edit Case Page Mock Data Removal - COMPLETE

## Summary
Successfully removed all mock data from the Edit Case page and implemented complete real API integration with comprehensive field mapping and CRUD operations.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Frontend Changes (Edit Case Page)
**File**: `src/app/call-centre/cases/[id]/edit/page.tsx`

#### Removed:
- ❌ Duplicate useEffect hooks with hardcoded mock data
- ❌ Mock case data with static values (Mary Chikuni, John Mukamuri, etc.)
- ❌ Simulated API call delays
- ❌ All hardcoded test data

#### Added:
- ✅ Real API integration for data fetching from `/api/call-centre/calls?id={caseId}`
- ✅ Comprehensive field transformation between API and form structure
- ✅ Error handling for failed API calls
- ✅ Fallback empty data structure if API fails
- ✅ Real save functionality with comprehensive field mapping
- ✅ Enhanced case closing functionality with proper API calls

### 2. Backend API Enhancement
**File**: `src/app/api/call-centre/cases/route.ts`

#### Enhanced PUT endpoint to support:
- ✅ Comprehensive field updates (45+ fields)
- ✅ Client information updates (name, phone, age, gender, province, address)
- ✅ Case details updates (priority, category, description, purpose)
- ✅ Action tracking (actionsTaken, nextAction, referrals)
- ✅ Follow-up management (dates, requirements, notes)
- ✅ Resolution and outcome tracking
- ✅ Proper field mapping between frontend and database

### 3. Data Flow Integration

#### Complete CRUD Operations:
1. **CREATE**: Already handled by main calls API
2. **READ**: Real data fetching from database via API
3. **UPDATE**: Comprehensive field updates through PUT endpoint
4. **DELETE**: Case closing functionality (status change to 'Closed')

#### Field Mapping:
- Frontend form fields ↔ API payload ↔ Database schema
- Proper fallback handling for missing data
- Consistent naming between layers

## Technical Details

### API Endpoints Used:
- **GET** `/api/call-centre/calls?id={caseId}` - Fetch individual case data
- **PUT** `/api/call-centre/cases?id={caseId}` - Update case information

### Data Transformation:
```javascript
// API Response → Frontend Form
clientName: data.clientName || data.callerName || ''
callPurpose: data.purpose || data.subject || ''
followUpDate: data.followUpDate ? new Date(data.followUpDate).toISOString().split('T')[0] : ''

// Frontend Form → API Update
updateData: {
  status, assignedOfficer, priority, caseType,
  clientName, clientPhone, clientAge, clientGender,
  callPurpose, description, actionsTaken, nextAction,
  referrals, notes, followUpDate, resolution, outcome
}
```

### Error Handling:
- API connection failures
- Data transformation errors
- User feedback with alerts
- Graceful fallbacks

## Testing Validation

### Verified Components:
- ✅ No TypeScript compilation errors
- ✅ No mock data references found in codebase
- ✅ Real API integration properly implemented
- ✅ Comprehensive field mapping in place
- ✅ Error handling implemented
- ✅ Development server running successfully

### User Experience:
- ✅ Edit Case page loads real data from database
- ✅ All form fields are properly populated
- ✅ Save functionality updates database with complete information
- ✅ Case closing properly changes status and redirects
- ✅ Error messages shown for failed operations

## Impact

### Before:
- Edit Case page showed hardcoded mock data
- No real database integration
- Simulated save operations with no actual updates
- Duplicate code with maintenance issues

### After:
- Complete real-time database integration
- All user input properly saved and retrievable
- Professional CRUD operations
- Clean, maintainable code structure
- Comprehensive field support matching frontend form capabilities

## Next Steps

The Edit Case page is now fully integrated with real data and provides complete case management functionality. Users can:

1. View real case information from the database
2. Edit any field in the comprehensive form
3. Save changes that persist in the database
4. Close cases with proper status updates
5. Navigate seamlessly through the case management workflow

All mock data has been successfully removed from the call centre system's Edit Case functionality.
