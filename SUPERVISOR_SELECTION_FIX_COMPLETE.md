üéØ SUPERVISOR/REVIEWER SELECTION FIX - COMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION
===============================================================

## ‚úÖ ISSUE RESOLVED: Supervisor Dropdown Now Includes Marked Supervisors/Reviewers

**User Request**: "where even we label employee as supervisor and reviewer, those people should be listed in the field of choosing supervisors, when creating and edit employees"

**Solution Implemented**: Updated the supervisor selection API to include employees marked as `is_supervisor: true` or `is_reviewer: true`

## üîß Technical Changes Made:

### 1. Updated Supervisors API (`/api/hr/employees/supervisors/route.ts`):

**Before**: Only fetched users based on position titles containing "manager", "supervisor", etc.

**After**: 
- ‚úÖ **Primary Selection**: Employees marked as `is_supervisor: true` OR `is_reviewer: true`
- ‚úÖ **Secondary Selection**: Employees with manager-like positions as fallback
- ‚úÖ **Combined Logic**: Merges both lists and removes duplicates
- ‚úÖ **Data Transformation**: Returns proper supervisor data for dropdown

### 2. Enhanced Selection Logic:
```sql
-- Primary: Get employees marked as supervisors/reviewers
WHERE status = 'ACTIVE' AND (is_supervisor = true OR is_reviewer = true)

-- Secondary: Get position-based supervisors  
WHERE status = 'ACTIVE' AND position ILIKE '%manager%'

-- Result: Combined unique list for supervisor dropdown
```

### 3. Data Structure Returned:
```javascript
{
  id: user.id,           // User ID for relationship
  employeeId: "EMP1001", // Employee identifier  
  firstName: "John",     // Display name
  lastName: "Smith",     // Display name
  position: "Manager",   // Job title
  department: "HR",      // Department
  email: "john@org",     // Contact
  isSupervisor: true,    // Supervisor flag
  isReviewer: false      // Reviewer flag
}
```

## üìä Current Supervisor Pool:

### Test Data Setup:
We marked specific employees as supervisors/reviewers:

1. **Jimmy Wilford (EMP1001)**:
   - Position: Software Developer - Senior
   - Flags: ‚úÖ Supervisor ‚úÖ Reviewer
   - Available in dropdown: ‚úÖ

2. **John Smith (EMP676578)**:
   - Position: Project Manager
   - Flags: ‚úÖ Supervisor ‚ùå Reviewer
   - Available in dropdown: ‚úÖ

3. **System Administrator (EMP675890)**:
   - Position: System Administrator
   - Flags: ‚ùå Supervisor ‚úÖ Reviewer
   - Available in dropdown: ‚úÖ

### Dropdown Selection Result:
**Total Available Supervisors**: 3 employees
- 2 marked as supervisors
- 2 marked as reviewers  
- 1 position-based manager

## üéØ User Experience Flow:

### Creating New Employee:
1. User clicks "Add New Employee"
2. Navigates to "Employment Information" step
3. Supervisor dropdown now shows:
   - Jimmy Wilford (Software Developer - Senior)
   - John Smith (Project Manager)
   - System Administrator (System Administrator)
4. User can select any of these as supervisor

### Editing Existing Employee:
1. User clicks "Edit" on employee
2. Employment step shows current supervisor (if any)
3. Dropdown includes all employees marked as supervisors/reviewers
4. User can change supervisor selection

### Marking Employee as Supervisor/Reviewer:
1. In employee form, go to "Role & Permissions" step
2. Check "Is Supervisor" checkbox ‚úÖ
3. Check "Is Reviewer" checkbox ‚úÖ
4. Save employee
5. **Immediately available** in supervisor dropdown for other employees

## üîÑ Dynamic Updates:

### Real-time Supervisor List Updates:
- When employee is marked as supervisor ‚Üí Appears in all supervisor dropdowns
- When employee is marked as reviewer ‚Üí Appears in all supervisor dropdowns  
- When employee is unmarked ‚Üí Removed from supervisor dropdowns
- Position-based managers always included as fallback

## ‚úÖ Verification Steps:

### 1. Test Supervisor Marking:
```
1. Edit any employee (e.g., Sharon Mazwi)
2. Go to "Role & Permissions" step
3. Check "Is Supervisor" 
4. Save employee
5. Create new employee ‚Üí Sharon appears in supervisor dropdown
```

### 2. Test Reviewer Marking:
```
1. Edit any employee (e.g., Takesure Marozva)
2. Go to "Role & Permissions" step  
3. Check "Is Reviewer"
4. Save employee
5. Create new employee ‚Üí Takesure appears in supervisor dropdown
```

### 3. Test Combined Selection:
```
Current supervisor dropdown includes:
- Employees with is_supervisor = true
- Employees with is_reviewer = true  
- Employees with manager-like positions
- All combined without duplicates
```
