## üîÄ Conditional Logic Application

### Recommended Configuration

**When user selects "Never" for Q2:**

Hide questions 3-12 (all service quality questions):
- ‚úÖ Q3: Prompt response
- ‚úÖ Q4: Knowledgeable reps
- ‚úÖ Q5: Wait time
- ‚úÖ Q6: Professionalism
- ‚úÖ Q7: Accurate information
- ‚úÖ Q8: Meets expectations
- ‚úÖ Q9: Active listening
- ‚úÖ Q10: Follow-up
- ‚úÖ Q11: Service access
- ‚úÖ Q12: Overall satisfaction

**Always keep visible:**
- ‚úÖ Q1: Gender (demographic)
- ‚úÖ Q2: Call frequency (trigger question)
- ‚úÖ Q13: Would refer (valuable even from non-users)
- ‚úÖ Q14: Recommendations (feedback from everyone)

### Why This Makes Sense

| Question | Show to Non-Users? | Reasoning |
|----------|-------------------|-----------|
| Q1-Q2 | ‚úÖ Yes | Demographic and screening |
| Q3-Q12 | ‚ùå No | Can't evaluate service they haven't used |
| Q13 | ‚úÖ Yes | They might know about the service reputation |
| Q14 | ‚úÖ Yes | Valuable feedback on why they don't use it |
