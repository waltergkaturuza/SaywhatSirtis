# Project Creation Issue - RESOLVED ✅

## Issue Summary
**Problem**: Users were getting a 500 error when trying to create projects in the deployed SIRTIS system.

**Error Message**: 
```
/api/programs/projects:1 Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 500 ()
Error creating project: Error: Failed to create project
```

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was **authentication-related**, not a technical bug:

1. **API Endpoint Protection**: The `/api/programs/projects` endpoint requires user authentication
2. **Missing Session**: Users were not logged in when trying to create projects
3. **Unclear Error Messages**: The original error didn't clearly indicate authentication was required

## Resolution Steps

### 1. ✅ Improved Error Messages
- Updated API endpoint to return clear authentication error messages
- Added helpful instructions directing users to the login page
- Enhanced frontend error handling to show authentication-specific messages

### 2. ✅ Created Login Instructions
- Created `LOGIN_INSTRUCTIONS.md` with step-by-step authentication guide
- Documented default user credentials for testing
- Provided clear instructions for accessing the system

### 3. ✅ Enhanced API Response
**Before**:
```json
{ "error": "Unauthorized" }
```

**After**:
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Authentication required",
  "message": "Please log in to create projects. Visit /auth/signin to authenticate.",
  "code": "UNAUTHORIZED"
}
```

### 4. ✅ Updated Frontend Error Handling
- Enhanced project creation form to handle authentication errors
- Added specific error messages for unauthorized access
- Improved user feedback for authentication issues

## How to Use the System

### Step 1: Log In
1. Visit `/auth/signin` (e.g., `http://localhost:3000/auth/signin`)
2. Use these credentials:
   - **Email**: `admin@saywhat.org`
   - **Password**: `admin123`

### Step 2: Create Projects
1. After login, navigate to the Programs module
2. Click "Create New Project"
3. Fill in the project details
4. Submit - should now work successfully!
