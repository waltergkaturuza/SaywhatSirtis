### 1. Audit Log Error (RESOLVED ‚úÖ):
**Problem**: Foreign key constraint violation when creating audit logs
```
Foreign key constraint violated on the constraint: `audit_logs_userId_fkey`
```

**Root Cause**: 
- `session.user.id` didn't match valid user ID in database
- Archive operation succeeded but audit logging failed

**Solution Applied**:
```javascript
// Before (causing error):
userId: session.user.id,

// After (fixed):
const sessionUser = await prisma.users.findFirst({
  where: { email: session.user.email },
  select: { id: true }
})
userId: sessionUser?.id || null,
```

**Result**: ‚úÖ Audit logs now create successfully without errors
